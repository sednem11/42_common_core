# 42 Common Core Projects

Welcome! This repository serves as a portfolio of all the projects I've completed during the **42 Common Core** curriculum — a rigorous, peer-driven program
focused on low-level programming, algorithms, system design, and software engineering fundamentals.

## 🏫 About 42

> [42](https://42.fr/en/homepage/) is a renowned coding school with a unique approach: no teachers, no classes — just project-based, peer-to-peer learning.
> The Common Core is the foundation of the program, covering everything from the basics of C programming to complex algorithms and system-level development.
